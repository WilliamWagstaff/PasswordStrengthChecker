This C# program checks the strength of a given password, from "very weak" to "very strong".
It can be run using the standard .NET CLI, and is meant purely for academic/educational purposes.
DO NOT rely on this program to test the strength of any actual passwords you intend to use, as doing so could give a false sense of security.
